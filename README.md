# RAG-AI-Agent(WIP)
A lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** AI agent that ingests data from the **NYC Capital Projects dataset** and answers user questions with relevant, context-aware responses grounded in the ingested data.The agent is designed to operate independently and can be integrated into other applications or services. A **web application** is provided as a testing and interaction tool, allowing users to easily query and validate the agent’s capabilities.


 ## Stack
- **Go** — Core language for building the **RAG AI agent**
- **Weaviate** — Vector database used by the **RAG AI agent** for storing and retrieving embeddings
- **GRPC** — High-performance communication between microservices
- **Ollama** — Local LLM runtime for serving LLaMA 2
- **Llama 2** — Large Language Model for context-aware response generation


 ## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for accurate, data-grounded responses  
- **Semantic search** powered by vector embeddings  
- **Context-aware responses** generated using **LLaMA 2**  
- **Microservices-based architecture** for modularity and scalability  
- **Web-App** for testing and interacting with the AI agent

 ## Microservices Details
The system is built using a **microservices architecture**:

- **RAG-IA-Agent-Service (Go)** — Handles queries, coordinates embedding retrieval, and orchestrates the AI agent  
- **Weaviate Database** — Stores and retrieves vector embeddings for semantic search  
- **Ollama (LLaMA 2)** — Generates natural language responses based on context  
- **Web-Application-Service** — Small Web-App for testing and interacting with the AI agent

 ## Data source
The agent’s knowledge comes from   **data.cityofnewyork.us**, with data currently imported via a CSV file. This ingestion method is fully flexible—CSV loading can easily be replaced with direct API-based retrieval, since  **data.cityofnewyork.us** provides both CSV exports and a public API for accessing the capital projects information.



 ## Setup and Running the Project
### 1. Start services

Start all services using Docker Compose --> from the project folder, run the following command:

```bash
make up_build
```

 ### 2. Accessing the Web Application
 Once all services are running, access the frontend in your browser:


```bash
http://localhost:4000
```
After opening the app, the UI looks like the following:

From here, you can:

- Type questions about NYC capital projects in the chat interface.
- Receive concise, professional, and friendly responses generated by the RAG AI Agent.
- See the following examples.

### Example Question #1

### Example Question #2

**Question:**  
What are the main objectives and expected benefits of the emergency technology infrastructure upgrade to improve public safety response times?

**Answer:**  
The main objective of the emergency technology infrastructure upgrade is to enhance public safety response times by providing faster and more reliable communication systems, improved data analytics, and enhanced situational awareness. This will enable emergency responders to quickly and effectively respond to incidents, saving precious time and lives.....
